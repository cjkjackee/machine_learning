## note 
### decision tree
- [id3 algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdTKxGQvYdc&t=1s)
- for continuous data
	- calculate mean
	- create node that have children which are greater than mean & smaller than mean
- i have limit the tree depth as 5 to make the tree generate process more faster

### random forest
- simply reuse the decision tree function to generate some decision tree
